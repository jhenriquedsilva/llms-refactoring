### Analysis

This code contains several *repeated expressions*, especially in the methods:

- `hasAll`, `hasAllExplicitly`, `hasAny`, and `hasAnyExplicitly`

where the following expressions are *repeated*:
- `Arrays.asList(mods)`
- `getEffectiveModifiers()` and `getExplicitModifiers()`
- `actual.contains(mod1)`
- logic for "all of ... ", "any of ..."

**Extract Variable** refactoring would make sense if an expression is used multiple times in a method and extracting it improves readability without loss of clarity.

Looking through your code, typical candidates for this are repeated calls to `getEffectiveModifiers()` and `getExplicitModifiers()` at the start of respective methods, and their assignment to a local `Set<JModifier> actual` variable. This has already been done, so no gain in extracting further.

However, for the logic parts:
```java
return actual.contains(mod1) && (mods.length == 0 || actual.containsAll(Arrays.asList(mods)));
```
and
```java
return actual.contains(mod1) || Arrays.stream(mods).anyMatch(actual::contains);
```
the expression `Arrays.asList(mods)` appears twice in the class in similar `hasAll` style methods, and `Arrays.stream(mods)` appears twice. Extracting these to a variable would improve readability only slightly (since they're only used once per method), but might help in code consistency.

#### Micro-optimization

- In methods receiving varargs `JModifier... mods`, it's efficient and idiomatic to assign `Arrays.asList(mods)` or `Arrays.stream(mods)` to a variable if used more than onceâ€”or for clarity.
- But here it's *only* used once per method, *and* the method is tiny: extracting to a variable might be overkill.

#### Conclusion

**There are no strong extract variable refactoring opportunities** in this class according to the extract-variable principle (removal of repeated expressions for improved readability and maintainability).

**Therefore, no refactoring is necessary.**
