**Analysis for Rename Parameter Refactoring Opportunities**

Reviewing the code, the most prominent candidates for rename parameter refactoring are found in:
- Method parameters (especially event handler/overridden ones)
- Local variables are less critical than parameters for this refactoring.

In Java convention, parameter names should be descriptive, preferably matching their roles.

Let's look at some common parameter names that might benefit from improvement:

### Examples from the Code

- Many overridden `WebSocketListener` methods use parameters such as `WebSocket webSocket`, `String text`, `Throwable t`, `Response response`, `int code`, `String reason`.
- These are standard parameter names in the OkHttp3/WebSocket API and are both conventional and descriptive. Changing these would reduce familiarity for a Java developer.

Elsewhere:
- In the test harness, parameters like `MockWebServer webServer` are used, already clear and descriptive.
- Helper methods like `closeWebSockets(WebSocket webSocket, WebSocket server)` use `webSocket` and `server`. More descriptive might be `clientWebSocket` and `serverWebSocket`, but within context, this is already clear, especially as one is always `serverListener.assertOpen()`.

### Are Improvements Worthwhile?

In all cases, parameter names are consistent, descriptive, and idiomatic for their context within OkHttp/WebSocket testing. There are no low-quality or ambiguous identifiers.

## Conclusion

**No refactoring is necessary.**
All parameter names are sufficiently descriptive, conventional, and contextually appropriate in this code.
