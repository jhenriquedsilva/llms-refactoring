There **are** meaningful extract variable refactoring opportunities in this code! In particular, the following pattern is repeated many times:

```java
Events tests = executeTestsForClass(SomeClass.class).testEvents();
```

as well as

```java
String msg = String.format(..., testClass.getCanonicalName());
Events tests = executeTestsForClass(testClass).testEvents();
assertFailingWithMessage(tests, msg);
```

We can refactor repeated calls to `executeTestsForClass(X).testEvents()` by extracting the "test events" value into a variable more aggressively if not already done. Similarly, in several methods (`blankCloseMethodName`, `primitiveTypeCannotBeClosed`, `arrayCannotBeClosed`, etc.), the block

```java
Class<?> testClass = ...;
String msg = String.format(..., testClass.getCanonicalName());
Events tests = executeTestsForClass(testClass).testEvents();
assertFailingWithMessage(tests, msg);
```

can be replaced by a call to a helper or by extracting the repeated expressions. However, **the code already does this well** for `assertMissingCloseMethod` and similar. That means **most low-hanging extract variable refactoring is already well applied.**

There are a few other cases with repeated strings, such as `"FailingFieldsTestCase.field1.close()"` and similar, but they have a reason (different semantics/ordering).

Additionally, the string

```java
String expected[] = { ..."xxx.close()", ... }
```

is only used twice, and it's already extracted as a variable.

**TL;DR: This code is already well-factored and applies extract variable refactorings where beneficial. No further extract variable refactoring is necessary.**

**Final Statement:**

> No extract variable refactoring is necessary; the code is already well-factored in that regard.
