Certainly! Let's do a quick review for possible **Extract Variable Refactoring** opportunities — this specifically means: "replace a repeating (and non-trivial) expression with a variable, to improve readability or reduce repetition."

### Summary of Review

Upon review, there **are** a few minor yet beneficial extract variable opportunities. The candidates are:

#### 1. `this.uri != null ? this.uri : uriBuilderFactory.expand("")`
- Found in `DefaultRequestBodyUriSpec.initUri()`
- This expression is used only once, so not necessarily worth extracting.

#### 2. `filterFunctions != null ? filterFunctions.andThen(filterFunction) : filterFunction`
- Inside `exchange()`, currently:
    ```java
    if (filterFunctions != null) {
        filterFunction = filterFunctions.andThen(filterFunction);
    }
    ```
- You can replace this conditional logic with a single assignment using a variable, e.g.
    ```java
    ExchangeFilterFunction finalFilterFunction = (filterFunctions != null
        ? filterFunctions.andThen(filterFunction)
        : filterFunction);
    ```

#### 3. Multiple calls to `WebClientUtils.getRequestDescription(...) + " [DefaultWebClient]"`
- Occurs in a few places as part of checkpoint messages.

#### 4. Multiple `Arrays.asList(...)`
- For single-argument method chains (like `.setAccept(Arrays.asList(...))`) it's not very beneficial to extract; thus, best left as is for brevity.

#### 5. Patterns like `onErrorResume(ex -> releaseIfNotConsumed(response, ex));`
- Not repeated enough in single method to be worth extracting.

#### 6. Repeated calls like `handler.test(statusCode)` in a loop — this is idiomatic and clear as is.

#### 7. In `private void initHeaders(...)` and `private void initCookies(...)`:
- Both methods have a pattern:
    ```java
    if (!CollectionUtils.isEmpty(default....)) {
        out.putAll(default....);
    }
    if (!CollectionUtils.isEmpty(this....)) {
        out.putAll(this....);
    }
    ```
  This is adequately readable and not duplicated across methods.

### Conclusion

There are **no** sufficiently notable repeated expressions where Extract Variable Refactoring would substantially improve the code. The minor candidates either do not appear more than once, are single-line/obvious, or their extraction would worsen clarity.

**Therefore, no refactoring is necessary. The code is already clean in terms of extract variable opportunities.**
