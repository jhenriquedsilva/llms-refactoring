# LLMs for refactoring

## Introduction
This repository is part of an undergraduate capstone project developed at Universidade Federal do Par√°(UFPA). Its goal is to evaluate how well LLMs do refactoring. The prompts and code samples were extracted from this other [study](https://github.com/bitselab/LLM4Refactoring), which is focused on investigating LLMs capabilities on refactoring too. Here it is possible to find all the data related to the work.

## General Information
All the code examples are written in the Java programming language.
ChatGPT 4.1, the version released at 04/14/2024, was the model chosen as the LLM to answer the prompts because at the date of the execution of this study it was the best model for coding tasks. 

## Project structure
Each directory represents a refactoring type. Inside each of them, there are other directories which represent examples of that type of refactoring. For each example, it is available the prompt used to request the refactoring and five answers to the prompt. The prompt was executed five times for each example. Each answer files also registers the date and time when the answer was received from the model.
