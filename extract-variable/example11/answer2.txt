Yes, there **are opportunities for extract variable refactoring** in the provided code. The goal of “extract variable” is to make repeated or complex expressions clearer by assigning them once to a local variable, improving readability and maintainability.

Below are **two main opportunities** found in your class:
- The repeated expression `exchange.getRequest()` in the `associate` method.
- The complex String expression in the `toString()` method has some repeated calls (`getClass().getSimpleName()`, `hashCode()`, etc.), but since each is only used once, it’s not worth extracting in this case.

### Refactored code with extract variable refactoring:

```java
package org.eclipse.jetty.client;

import org.eclipse.jetty.client.api.Connection;
import org.eclipse.jetty.client.api.Result;
import org.eclipse.jetty.io.CyclicTimeouts;
import org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.AutoLock;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public abstract class HttpChannel implements CyclicTimeouts.Expirable
{
    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HttpChannel.class);

    private final AutoLock _lock = new AutoLock();
    private final HttpDestination _destination;
    private HttpExchange _exchange;

    protected HttpChannel(HttpDestination destination)
    {
        _destination = destination;
    }

    public void destroy()
    {
    }

    public HttpDestination getHttpDestination()
    {
        return _destination;
    }

    /**
     * <p>Associates the given {@code exchange} to this channel in order to be sent over the network.</p>
     * <p>If the association is successful, the exchange can be sent. Otherwise, the channel must be
     * disposed because whoever terminated the exchange did not do it - it did not have the channel yet.</p>
     *
     * @param exchange the exchange to associate
     * @return true if the association was successful, false otherwise
     */
    public boolean associate(HttpExchange exchange)
    {
        boolean result = false;
        boolean abort = true;
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock())
        {
            if (_exchange == null)
            {
                abort = false;
                result = exchange.associate(this);
                if (result)
                    _exchange = exchange;
            }
        }

        // Extract variable for repeated 'exchange.getRequest()'
        var request = exchange.getRequest();

        if (abort)
        {
            request.abort(new UnsupportedOperationException("Pipelined requests not supported"));
        }
        else
        {
            request.setConnection(getConnection());
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
                LOG.debug("{} associated {} to {}", exchange, result, this);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public boolean disassociate(HttpExchange exchange)
    {
        boolean result = false;
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock())
        {
            HttpExchange existing = _exchange;
            _exchange = null;
            if (existing == exchange)
            {
                existing.disassociate(this);
                result = true;
            }
        }

        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
            LOG.debug("{} disassociated {} from {}", exchange, result, this);
        return result;
    }

    public HttpExchange getHttpExchange()
    {
        try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock())
        {
            return _exchange;
        }
    }

    protected abstract Connection getConnection();

    @Override
    public long getExpireNanoTime()
    {
        HttpExchange exchange = getHttpExchange();
        return exchange != null ? exchange.getExpireNanoTime() : Long.MAX_VALUE;
    }

    protected abstract HttpSender getHttpSender();

    protected abstract HttpReceiver getHttpReceiver();

    public void send()
    {
        HttpExchange exchange = getHttpExchange();
        if (exchange != null)
            send(exchange);
    }

    public abstract void send(HttpExchange exchange);

    public abstract void release();

    public void proceed(HttpExchange exchange, Throwable failure)
    {
        getHttpSender().proceed(exchange, failure);
    }

    public boolean abort(HttpExchange exchange, Throwable requestFailure, Throwable responseFailure)
    {
        boolean requestAborted = false;
        if (requestFailure != null)
            requestAborted = getHttpSender().abort(exchange, requestFailure);

        boolean responseAborted = false;
        if (responseFailure != null)
            responseAborted = abortResponse(exchange, responseFailure);

        return requestAborted || responseAborted;
    }

    public boolean abortResponse(HttpExchange exchange, Throwable failure)
    {
        return getHttpReceiver().abort(exchange, failure);
    }

    public Result exchangeTerminating(HttpExchange exchange, Result result)
    {
        return result;
    }

    public void exchangeTerminated(HttpExchange exchange, Result result)
    {
        disassociate(exchange);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString()
    {
        return String.format("%s@%x(exchange=%s)", getClass().getSimpleName(), hashCode(), getHttpExchange());
    }
}
```

**Summary of changes:**
- In `associate(HttpExchange exchange)`, extracted `exchange.getRequest()` result to a local variable `request` as it is used twice.

**No further repeated complex expressions** have been found that merit extraction. If you need more aggressive refactoring for other patterns (such as handling logger calls), let me know!
