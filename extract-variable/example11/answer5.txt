Let's review the code for repeated expressions that could be improved via *extract variable* refactorings (extracting an expression into a local variable for readability, maintainability, and potentially to reduce repeated computation or code duplication).

**Typical candidates** are:
- Calling a getter multiple times in succession
- String.format chains with repeated sub-expressions
- Repeated constructions of the same object
- Long chained calls or expressions repeated in multiple places in a method

Let's analyze the code:

### Possible Candidates

#### 1. `exchange.getRequest()` in `associate`
```java
if (abort)
{
    exchange.getRequest().abort(new UnsupportedOperationException("Pipelined requests not supported"));
}
else
{
    exchange.getRequest().setConnection(getConnection());
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
        LOG.debug("{} associated {} to {}", exchange, result, this);
}
```
Here, `exchange.getRequest()` is called twice in different branches. We could extract it into a local variable, e.g., `Request request = exchange.getRequest();` to improve readability.

#### 2. `LOG.debug(...)` appears with repeated arguments, but not in a way that can be refactored by variable.

#### 3. `getHttpExchange()` in `send()`, `getExpireNanoTime()`, and `toString()`:
  - In each place where it's used, it's only called once, so no benefit from extraction.

#### 4. Other methods don't have obvious extraction opportunities as per the extract variable pattern.

### **Refactored Code**

Only the `associate` method provides a solid case for variable extraction/refactoring:

```java
public boolean associate(HttpExchange exchange)
{
    boolean result = false;
    boolean abort = true;
    try (AutoLock ignored = _lock.lock())
    {
        if (_exchange == null)
        {
            abort = false;
            result = exchange.associate(this);
            if (result)
                _exchange = exchange;
        }
    }

    Request request = exchange.getRequest(); // Extracted variable

    if (abort)
    {
        request.abort(new UnsupportedOperationException("Pipelined requests not supported"));
    }
    else
    {
        request.setConnection(getConnection());
        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
            LOG.debug("{} associated {} to {}", exchange, result, this);
    }

    return result;
}
```

The rest of the code remains the same.

```

**Summary:**
Yes, an extract variable refactoring opportunity was found for the usage of `exchange.getRequest()` in the `associate` method, which improves readability and ensures the request object is only retrieved once per association attempt. The rest of the code did not require such refactorings.
