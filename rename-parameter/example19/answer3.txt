Here is a systematic review of the code for **rename parameter refactoring opportunities**. I will pay special attention to parameter names that are unclear, ambiguous, non-descriptive, or single letters that could be improved.

Below are the method signatures and their parameters:

### Analyzed Method Parameters

- `customizeClientBuilder(ClientBuilder clientBuilder, PulsarConnectionDetails connectionDetails)`
- `customizeAdminBuilder(PulsarAdminBuilder adminBuilder, PulsarConnectionDetails connectionDetails)`
- `customizeAuthentication(AuthenticationConsumer authentication, PulsarProperties.Authentication properties)`
- `<T> customizeProducerBuilder(ProducerBuilder<T> producerBuilder)`
- `<T> customizeConsumerBuilder(ConsumerBuilder<T> consumerBuilder)`
- `customizeConsumerBuilderSubscription(ConsumerBuilder<?> consumerBuilder)`
- `customizeContainerProperties(PulsarContainerProperties containerProperties)`
- `customizePulsarContainerConsumerSubscriptionProperties(PulsarContainerProperties containerProperties)`
- `customizePulsarContainerListenerProperties(PulsarContainerProperties containerProperties)`
- `<T> customizeReaderBuilder(ReaderBuilder<T> readerBuilder)`
- `customizeReaderContainerProperties(PulsarReaderContainerProperties readerContainerProperties)`
- `timeoutProperty(BiConsumer<Integer, TimeUnit> setter)`

#### Internal Lambda Variables and Minor Parameters:
- The lambda in `timeoutProperty` uses `duration`
- Internal: `ex` as exception, `params` as the parameter map in `customizeAuthentication`

### Findings:

#### 1. Use of **`properties`** as parameter and field name

Multiple methods have `PulsarProperties.X properties = ...` locally, and several methods take `properties` as a parameter (`customizeAuthentication`, etc). However:
- In method signatures, `properties` always refers to a well-named type, e.g., `PulsarProperties.Authentication properties`.
- The class-level variable is also named `properties` (`private final PulsarProperties properties;`).
- Although this is repetitive, it is typical in Spring/Java, with the context of the type clarifying meaning.

#### 2. Use of ambiguous names:
- All significant method parameters have domain-appropriate names: `clientBuilder`, `connectionDetails`, `authentication`, etc.
- No single-letter or ambiguous variable names are used (except for typical exception variables like `ex`).
- Where generic parameters are used (e.g., `<T>`), the generic builder is always named `producerBuilder`, `consumerBuilder`, `readerBuilder`, etc. -- descriptive and unambiguous.

#### 3. Local variables:
- Within methods, all locals such as `PulsarProperties.Consumer.Subscription properties = ...` sometimes shadow method parameters but are always well scoped and named with the type as reference.
- Exception variables `ex` and `params`, `authParamString` are standard and do not reduce readability.

#### 4. Lambda arguments:
- Lambdas in the mapping logic clearly use target method references, e.g., `clientBuilder::serviceUrl`.
- Lambda in `timeoutProperty` uses `duration` as argument -- clear and appropriate.

---

**Conclusion:**
There are **NO rename parameter refactoring opportunities** in this code. All method parameters are well-named and contextually clear. No ambiguous or low-quality identifiers exist.

---

**Final verdict:**
No refactoring is necessary.
