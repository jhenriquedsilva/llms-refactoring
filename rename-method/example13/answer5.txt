Certainly! After carefully reviewing your code as requested, the main issue exists with some method names that are overly verbose or not completely clear. However, the method names in this code (like `cleanupModeDefaultField`, `cleanupModeCustomDefaultField`, etc.) are actually **quite descriptive** and follow a consistent convention, especially for test methods where context is given by the class they are inside.

That said, if your **goal is to improve readability and follow a more concise and standard test-naming pattern** (which usually uses the format: `should<ExpectedBehavior>When<Condition>`), then some opportunities exist for refactoring. For example:

- `cleanupModeDefaultField()` → `shouldCleanupFieldDirByDefault()`
- `cleanupModeCustomDefaultField()` → `shouldNotCleanupFieldDirWithNeverCleanupModeConfigured()`
- `cleanupModeNeverField()` → `shouldNotCleanupFieldDirWithNeverCleanupMode()`
- `cleanupModeAlwaysField()` → `shouldCleanupFieldDirWithAlwaysCleanupMode()`
- `cleanupModeOnSuccessPassingField()` → `shouldCleanupFieldDirWithOnSuccessCleanupWhenTestPasses()`
- `cleanupModeOnSuccessFailingField()` → `shouldNotCleanupFieldDirWithOnSuccessCleanupWhenTestFails()`
- and so on for parameter test methods.

However, in most professional Java projects, especially ones involving test code, the **existing verbose names are justifiable for clarity**. No actual "low quality" identifier is present here.

**Conclusion:**
Your method names are clear, context-aware, and easy to understand. No rename method refactoring is necessary based on standard best practices.

**If you'd like to proceed with the alternate, more behavior-focused naming anyway, please confirm and I can generate the refactored class as requested.**
