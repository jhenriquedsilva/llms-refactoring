Certainly! Here is a review focused on **rename parameter refactoring**—in particular, improving low-quality parameter names. I have checked the code, especially method declarations and anonymous inner classes for parameter names.

## Key Observations

- In your test class, **most methods have no parameters**, or parameters are local to lambdas/anonymous classes (e.g., `onOpen(WebSocket webSocket, Response response)`).
- The parameters use standard, clear names (`webSocket`, `response`, `code`, `reason`, `request`, `t`, etc.) which are self-explanatory for developers familiar with OkHttp/WebSocket terminology.
- **No parameter has a name that is low quality** (like `a`, `b`, `obj`, `s1`, etc.), nor are there overloaded names or unclear single-letter names that would benefit from immediate refactoring.
- The private helper methods also have meaningful parameter names (`webSocket`, `server`, `request`, etc.).

## Conclusion

**No rename parameter refactoring is necessary.**
All parameter names are clear and conventional, aligning with OkHttp’s domain and Java practices.


**If you have a specific method or section where you see low-quality parameter names, please indicate it. Otherwise, as per this snippet, parameter naming is already well done and no refactoring is required.**
