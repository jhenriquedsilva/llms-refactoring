Certainly! Let's **identify possible parameter rename refactoring opportunities** in your provided code snippet.

### What to look for

In "rename parameter" refactoring, the focus is on parameters of methods (especially public/protected, or those of custom utility/private methods) which have unclear names, overly short or misleading names that hamper readability.

#### Examining the code

I focused on:

- Method and lambda parameters within the class (not imports/external)
- Local variables, unless they are parameters to methods even in anonymous inner classes/lambdas
- Easy misnaming/unreadable parameter names (e.g., `e` for Exception is usually acceptable, but `t` for Throwable can sometimes be improved, etc.)
- Adhering to the context — in tests, short parameter names are often tolerated for brevity, but I'll call out any obvious improvements.

### Key method signatures in the code (excluding JUnit annotations):

**1. setUp(MockWebServer webServer)**
The parameter name is descriptive and matches the field being initialized.

**2. tearDown()**
No parameters.

**3. newWebSocket(Request request)**
Parameter is well-named.

**4. closeWebSockets(WebSocket webSocket, WebSocket server)**
Parameters are descriptive.

**5. successfulExtensions(String extensionsHeader)**
Parameter is clear.

**6. extensionNegotiationFailure(String extensionsHeader)**
Clear.

**7. upgradeResponse(RecordedRequest request)**
Parameter is descriptive.

**8. websocketScheme(String scheme)**
Descriptive.

Within methods, for example lambdas (like in `addInterceptor(chain -> { ... })`), “chain” is idiomatic.

For anonymous inner classes, e.g.:

```java
clientListener.setNextEventDelegate(new WebSocketListener() {
    @Override public void onOpen(WebSocket webSocket, Response response) {
        throw e;
    }
});
```

The parameters `webSocket` and `response` are clear.

Even Throwable parameters are named `t` or `e`, which is standard in Java for brevity, especially in tests.

### Are there any poorly named parameters?

After a **detailed and thorough review**, the code demonstrates good parameter naming practices. The identifiers are descriptive and match their roles.

#### Conclusion

**No rename parameter refactoring is necessary.**
All parameter names are clear, context-appropriate, and readable.

#### If you need suggestions for variable/internal refactoring (not parameters), please specify. Otherwise, your code is well-named regarding parameters!
