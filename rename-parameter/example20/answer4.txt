### Refactoring Opportunity: Rename Parameter

Upon reviewing the code, the following parameters have **low-quality or ambiguous names** and can benefit from a rename parameter refactoring for clarity:

- `bridgeMethod`: This is clear (refers to a bridge method in Java), so it **does not need renaming**.
- `candidateMethod`: This is clear.
- `targetClass`: This is clear.
- `candidateMethods`: This is clear.
- `specificMethod`: This is clear.
- `method`: Could be ambiguous in some contexts, but usually okay given it refers to Method objects. Still, in a few methods (especially those returning from `searchForMatch`, etc.), the returned `method` could be more descriptive.

However, their naming is already conformant to Java conventions and each reflects the actual usage and context. Sometimes, changing `method` to something like `matchedMethod`/`foundMethod` or `genericMethod` could help, but in most places, the code *already* uses those names when it adds useful detail.

No instances of names like `a`, `x`, or similar uninformative names are present.

#### Final Assessment:

**No rename parameter refactoring is necessary** in this code; the parameter names are already clear and descriptive.

---

**Response:**
> No refactoring is necessary. The code uses clear and descriptive parameter names consistent with Java conventions and the context of the methods.
